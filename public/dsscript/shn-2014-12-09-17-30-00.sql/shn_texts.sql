The artists have both decided on certain methods for the exhibition, which allow them to investigate ongoing concerns over the particular \'display\' of painting. This can be seen as a technique which is critical to the construction of the paintings themselves. As a technique it actualizes different method for interaction, where the autonomy of a single surface; the physical constraints that this brings to painting is shifted, subsequently enhancing the interconnectivity of the multiple panels. These different surfaces can be engaged, by the viewer, singularly but also across the constraints of the \'frame\' or edge. Frame as a device, or shape, would usually construct the particulars of surface and, at the same time distinguishes the plane from anything \'outside\'. In contrast the more \'theatrical\' installation enhances the connections between the different surfaces. This method highlights difference and subjects each surface, not only to differences evident within its own surface but also differences created in the connections between the different surfaces.  </p> <p> Sharon Hall’s new paintings exemplify a particular approach to the installation of painting and the questioning of the relationship between individual surfaces. The individual surfaces present multiple contradictions between ground and mark, form and the formless, order and chaos... </p> <p> It is not a self critical definition of painting but rather a mapping between different contradictory elements, emphasizing the dualistic approach, or a shadow play, which through the method of installation becomes more apparent. In essence the actual installation constructs an ‘in between’ where connections are made between and across the different paintings. </p>','2014-10-24 10:36:27','2014-11-10 11:38:34'),(2,'Surface Connections','David Ryan','2004','','','2004','<p>The idea behind this project was for each of the painters to explore their practice in relation to the particularities of the given space and also the other works in the show.

One of the five painters for each proposed venue takes charge of overall curatorial possibilities &ndash; including the relationship of the works, the general shape of the installation, as well as the invitation for a critic or practitioner regarding an accompanying written text etc. (for example, in the last realization, at the Holden Gallery in Manchester, Sharon Hall took on this curatorial role.)</p><p>The exhibition explored various matrices of surface around abstraction, architecture, the body, intentionality and contingency.

This is very clearly defined as an all-over colour charged lattice which mechanically fills the available area. The effect of the grid is to reinforce, even to the point of over emphasis, the finite planar character of painting itself, measuring out the full extension of the surface without remainder, to mark exactly the limits of the constructed pictorial field... to use a grid is to commit to abstraction and artifice, and set certain conditions which influence the other elements which the painting may contain, in particular those that come into conflict with the disciplined division of the canvas.</p><p>In Hall\\&#39;s work the dissident component is a looping meandering which seems at first to have escaped the grid\\&#39;s influence entirely, to roam casually and unhindered across the surface. However though it emerges as an expressive agent, its progress improvised intuitively to follow the path of a rhizoid growth within a schematic system; it nevertheless registers a response to its context. Instead of being the grid\\&#39;s opposite it assumes something of a schematic character itself, becoming in places partly decorative, or ornamental, in the musical sense, as it is wrought into baroque arabesques and curlicues which intersperse the looser linear sweeps.</p>','2014-10-24 10:47:17','2014-11-18 12:45:12'),(4,'The Borrowed Image','Amanda Farr','1995','catalogue essay','catalogue essay','1995','<p> One can draw an analogy between Hall’s paintings and musical composition: she sees her use of visual fragments from another era as a form of transposition-a word which implies both a change of place or order, and the rendering of music in a different key. The images are captured from a bygone time and place, like broken refrains or phrases from a vast chorus of history .They are used in counterpoint, juxtaposed with the formal language of abstraction, to form new possibilities of composition.[…] </p> <p> As suggested in the title, we are confronted with different histories and passages through time; that of White\'s original plan, which represents various dramatic occurrences that took place over a number of days, and that of a particular moment in history marked by the folding of the map, thus accidentally repeating recorded time through the mirroring of the image.

On the one hand they explore a potential for narrative content through her use of imagery, while on the other, a deep rooted concern with purely optical and formal devices remains extremely important. These oppositions are set up in a variety of ways, sometimes in the one canvas or even related pieces within a series (the Roma series for instance where image and linear ground are separated out.) Such a dialogue appears to explore the \'forgetfulness\' of the modernist autonomous object, and the attempt to hold on to a possibility of retrieving some form of \'truth content\' from the distant past. Where this is located is within the array of images, always seemingly fragmented or inconspicuous, yet painted with the belief that something can be unlocked...</p>','2014-10-24 11:00:53','2014-11-05 10:54:02'),(7,'review of Union Street Gallery exhibition, Time Out','Tania Guha','1994','Review of Union Street Gallery exhibition, Time Out','Time Out','1994','<p>The canvases are painted in delicate concoctions of colour: lavender-blues, rose-pinks, and pea-greens, for instance.

In Sharon Hall\'s case, as with many (one is tempted to say most) artists of her generation, it was a response to what was then called \'New Image\' painting, as exemplified by European painters of then late 70\'s and early 80\'s. Unlike many of her contemporaries, she did not awake one morning to find herself transformed into a fully fledged expressionist painter of archetypal imagery. Hall\'s engagement with the problems raised during that period was much slower, thoughtful and intelligent. Now that we have the opportunity to see her recent paintings it is clear that many of the issues from this period still persist and have been doggedly refined into a critical consideration of how images can be used in painting, indeed, how they can be used in conjunction with their own opposition. </p> <p>  The imagery Hall has been concerned with over the last few years has encompassed a wide range of both chronology and subject matter (there is, however, a visual consistency which partly results from her choice of pre-photographic modes of reproduction as source material.) A mere listing might suffice here: texts and images from the letters and diaries of the \'49ers\', childrens primers and educational aids, \'the world turned upside down\' tradition of populist prints, various early colonialist maps and engravings, as well as astronomical and navigational charts. The list might make clear her interest in the images: they are all self consciously \'historical\', they create a sort of temporal distance between their original connotation and their current re-fabrication, they often reveal rhetorical purely ideological element, and, formally, their linearity enables a curious relationship to occur with the other oppositional elements in the painting, namely the seemingly autonomous systematic mark making that seems to unfold the \'time\' of picture making in conjunction with the \'recitation\' of the images.  </p>','2014-10-24 11:02:47','2014-11-05 10:54:33'),(9,'Castlefield Gallery catalogue essay','Sacha Craddock','1993','Castlefield Gallery catalogue essay','','1993','<p>...in the recent paintings it becomes obvious that Hall has shifted her method. Instead of imposing a whole outlined oneness of intention upon the canvas she builds up a further layering of possible evidence through her working method. Instead of dealing absolutely by answering a question that could never be posed through painting she approaches the country\'s imperial past through a fragmented accumulation of drawing. An alternately faltering and fast line hints at recognisable images. These can be attractive, decisive and unclear all at the same time. This faltering and questioning thought process has by necessity lead to the rejection of a display of false clarity of vision. In the same way that Gerhard Richter paints the blur in order to show how both the personal and photographic memory are ungraspable and unreliable, Hall dissects and crosses the surface with a build up of delicate delineation.</p> <p>The relation between the process of thought and the activity of drawing is particularly naked here. By laying a trail across the canvas she describes a conceptual journey. The solid ground of so many \'clear\' historical narratives has been replaced by an active involvment. The soil has been loosened and disrupted. New territories are explored.</p>','2014-10-24 11:03:27','2014-11-05 10:54:52'),(10,'Review of Castelfield exhibition, City Life','Sue Platt','1993','Review of Castelfield exhibition, City Life','City Life','1994','<p>Through the intensely delicate marks, lines and fragments of freehand initiated wood cut trails; she translates the images in related clean colours from all directions, across painstaking blinds of line.

The disjunctive effect of the juxtaposition of two such widely different idioms is lessened because the surfaces themselves are ambiguous. On the one hand, because of the nature of the image, they can be seen to allude to the texture of wood grain in wood block printing; on the other hand they appear to have been created from controlled, but simple autonomous mark making. This characteristic of imagery emerging out of or relating to, the procedures and practises of minimal art has been a dominant feature of some of the most interesting and widely known British sculpture of the 80\'s, the work of Tony Cragg, Bill Woodrow and David Mach for example, but it has hardly been a feature of painting of the same period... The subjects relate to the theme of \'the world turned upside down\' and again obliquely refer to the state of contemporary society.
